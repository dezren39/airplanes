## GitHub GameOff Disclaimer

Most of this game was created during October 2022. I wanted to take part in GitHub GameOff,
but sadly didn't have enough time to create a new game.

I'm submitting this one and I hope this is still in the spirit of the competition since it was created pretty much within one month.
You be the judge. :)
